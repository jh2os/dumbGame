*Logger system

*Settings System

*Timer/FSP System

*Major System Initialization
	SDL_Window creation, Gl Context Creation

*Mesh/texture System
	Load meshes and textures and easily be able to display them

*Physics Model
	This is a model that has appropriate physics variables and easy to use
	functions. (Gravity, velocity, mass)

*	Modelspace Object (physics and object))
	This will be able to keep track of where a mesh should be displayed. 
	Multiple models can use the same mesh (keeps data seperated)

Audio system
	Handles loading in audio and playback (possibly distance variations)

Collision system
	Checks all physics objects to see if a collision happened between objects
	returns sets flags and calls physics onColide method. Holds collision map 
	data
